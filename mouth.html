        <div class="panel-body">Here's a quick and easy recipe fit for any person wanted to get into bread making.  Five ingredients and super easy!  You'll just need some time and a cast iron pot with lid.<br>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 cups flour
                <li>1/4 tsp instant yeast
                <li>1 1/4 tsp salt
            </ul>
        Combine flour, yeast, and salt. Mix to distribute evenly.
            <ul>   
                <li>1 1/2 cups cold water
                <li>1/2 tsp red wine vinegar (any vinegar will do)
            </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>Add vinegar to water, mix with flour mixture and stir until flour is incorporated; dough should be pretty stiff. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rest for 12-18 hours at about 70 degrees. When surface is dotted with bubbles, dough is ready.</p>

        <p>After the rest, place dough on well floured work surface (1/4 cup of flour) and knead (7-8 kneads) just to get some surface tension.</p>

        <p>Clean your bowl, or get a new one, and spray with non-stick spray. Sprinkle bottom of the bowl with sesame seeds if desired; transfer dough, seam side down, to bowl. Cover and let rise till doubled in size, about 2 hours.</p>

        <p>After 1 1/2 hours, prepare oven and baking dish. Place covered pot(4-8 qt) in oven and set to 435-450 degrees for 30 minutes. Pot and oven should be blazing hot!</p>

        <p>When dough has risen and oven and pot are ready, turn dough over into the pot seam side up. Cover, bake 27 min. Uncover, and continue baking for an additional 6-10 minutes until browned. Cool on a wire rack before cutting.</p>

        <p><strong>Note: </strong>I once left the bowl of dough out for 24 hours. My spouse kneaded it for me and then once I got home, 5 hours later, we baked it. It turned out great (actually, one of my better loaves) so I don't think you can go wrong letting it rise longer, especially in the wintertime.</p>

        <p>Here is a little timeline so you don't have to think about it. To have bread ready by 5:30/dinner time:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>8 pm: mix the dough
                <li>Noon-1 pm: knead the dough
                <li>4 pm: turn on oven and heat covered pot
                <li>4:30 pm: bake bread
                <li>5:10-15 pm: bread should be done!!
            </ul>

        <div class="panel-body">The key to good brussel sprouts is a good pan. A cast iron skillet or stainless steel are best. Leave the non-stick skillet in the cabinet for the eggs! You'll want some nice carmelization (brown/black edges) on your sprouts. <strong>Note: </strong>If your grocer has the brussel sprouts on the stock, all the better! A yummy addition is the sprout tops (little leafies on top) cooked alongside the sprouts.<br>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

            <p> Begin by cutting them in half and putting them aside. Now grab some fat (butter, olive oil, bacon) and get it nice and hot. Then, throw in some garlic or onions, cook for just a minute.</p>

            <p>Now throw in your sprouts! Let them cook until they are nice and dark green, lightly browned (even burnt edges is fine) <strong>- you may need to add a bit of water if the pot is getting too dry.</strong></p>

            <p>Season with a bit of salt and pepper.  Stir and serve on a beautiful platter.  Simple, easy and so good!</p>

        <div class="panel-body">The trick to chard is growing it yourself! It's a super hardy veggie and living in the midwest, we get lots of it in our garden every year! It's nice to cook and put alongside grilled chicken and rice.
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <p>Follow the recipe from the brussel sprouts section - only substitute the brussel sprouts for chard.  Really - it's that easy!  Maybe try to season with a bit of lemon juice before serving.</p>
